   	Sharekhan was founded by Mumbai-based entrepreneur Shripal Morakhia in 2000. Sharekhan pioneered the Indian online retail brokerage industry and leveraged on the first wave of digitization, when dematerialization (demat) of securities came into effect and electronic trading was introduced in the stock exchanges.[3]

As of 2018, Sharekhan has 4800+ employees, and was present in over 575 cities through 153 branches, and more than 2,500 business partners.[4] The company had 1.4 million customer base[5] and on an average, executes more than 4 lakh trades per day.
